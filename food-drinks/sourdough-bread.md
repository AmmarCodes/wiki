# Sourdough Bread

## Recipe

> These measurements should be sufficient to make 2 loafs

- 800g flour
- 460g water
- 10g salt
- 320g sourdough starter

## Steps

Mix all ingredients and start kneding until the dough's structure is similar to rubber, if you hold it it will stretch without tearing.

Let it set for 3 hours.

Take the dough out, put some oil on your hands and fold it a couple of times.

Spread some flour on the surface of the container that you want to shape the dough in, then make the dough rounded and place it inside, let it set for 3 hours.

Pre-heat the oven at max degree (~280Â°), either use dutch oven or place a boiling water inside the oven to keep steam inside.

Score the bread (cut it with sharp tool), then put it in the oven for ~25min.
