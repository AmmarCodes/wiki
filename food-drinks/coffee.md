# Coffee

I like to brew my own coffee, my mood swings between V60 drip coffee and Arabic/Turkish coffee.

I've read somewhere that dripping the coffee will reserve more useful compounds than boiling it, couldn't find a reference.

I can understand that some people might add sugar to the coffee, and some might add milk. I prefer the coffee plain without any additives.

## Mocha pot

It produces coffee with medium strength between espresso and filter coffee, it uses a lot of coffee grounds compared to filter coffee dripping.

I don't recommend it.
