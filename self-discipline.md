# Self Discipline

## What's self discipline?

It's the ability to do what you should be doing, it often means putting off your immediate comfort or wishes in favor of longterm success.

- Increase physical health
- Become more resilient
- Feel happier

## How to Build Self-Discipline

- Identify your weaknesses
- Create easy habits
- Use rewards when resist a temptation (this one didn't work for me, I will try it more consistently)
- Define the personal standards (personal limits - the absolute minimum)
- Look ahead - if a weakness is coming in a later situation, plan how you'd face it
- Make adjustments
- Focus on how you want yourself to be not on the goals itself
- Cold shower challenge
